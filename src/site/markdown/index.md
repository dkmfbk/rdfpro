<h3 class='no-before span4'>About</h3>

**RDFpro** (RDF Processor) is a public domain, Java command line tool and library for **RDF processing**.
RDFpro offers a suite of stream-oriented, highly optimized **RDF processors** for common tasks that can be assembled in complex **pipelines** to efficiently process RDF data in one or more passes.
RDFpro originated from the need of a tool supporting typical **Linked Data integration tasks**, involving dataset sizes up to few **billions triples**.
